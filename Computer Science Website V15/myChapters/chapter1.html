          <p class="lead" style="font-weight: bold;">Computational thinking is a problem solving approach that borrows techniques from computer science, notably abstraction, problem decomposition and the development of algorithms.</p>
		
		  <ol type="circle">
			  <li>Computational thinking can be applied to a wide variety of problems and not just the development of computer systems.</li>
			  
			  <p></p>
			  
			  <li>The four cornerstones of Computational Thinking:
				<ul type="square">
				  <li>Decomposition is where a complex problem is <b>broken down into smaller parts</b> which makes it a lot more manageable. These smaller parts are easier to work and solve.</li>
				  <li>Pattern Recognition is a technique that looks at similarities between and within smaller problems usually problems that have been decomposed. It works by looking at several problems and then <b>finding a pattern</b> between them this pattern allows the next problem to be predicted.</li>
				  <li>Abstraction is a technique which involves focusing on the needed information disregarding the <b>irrelevant detail</b>. The irrelevant, complex detail is suppressed below the needed information’s level. Abstraction allows a person to interact with an interface and not be surrounded with unnecessary items.</li>
				  <li>Algorithms are a series of <b>step-by-step calculations</b> that are needed to solve a problem.</li>
				</ul>
			  </li>
			  
			  <p></p>
			  
			  <li>Decomposition is the breaking down of a problem into smaller parts that are easier to solve.</li>
			  
			  <li>These smaller parts can be solved <b>recursively</b>. Solving something recursively is where you <b>run it again and again </b> until that part of the problem is solved.</li>
		  
			  <p></p>
			  
			  <li>There are different ways to use decomposition:
				<ul type="square">
				  <li><b>Top down design</b> is an approach that led to the widespread use of modular programming. <b>Modular programming</b> is where the program functionality is <b>separated into independent modules</b> which contains everything that is needed to execute that aspect of functionality. The top-down design gets an overall design of a program and splits a sub-problem into smaller components like a hierarchical tree-like structure. A disadvantage of this approach is that it assumes that you know whole solution to the problem in advance.</li>
				  <li>Using <b>alternative pathways</b> is another approach, where parallel processes are demonstrated with the use of alternate pathways.</li>
				  <li><b>Data flow diagram</b> could be used to show how <b>data is passed in a system</b>. This is useful to show how the major components and activities are set out in a system before going into detail of the algorithm development.</li>
				</ul>
			  </li>
			  
			  <p></p>
			  
			  <li>There are different ways to apply decomposition in computing scenarios. For example we can break a problem:
				<ul type="square">
				  <li>Into different functional components which lead to modules or program procedures.</li>
				  <li>Into processes, data stores and data flows.</li>
				</ul>
			  </li>
		  
			  <p></p>
			  
			  <li><b>Structured programming</b> is a programming <b>paradigm</b> (way of programming) where functions/procedures are designed to carry out a <b>limited set of jobs</b> - this improves clarity, readability and development time of a computer program.</li>

			  <li>Structured programming came about after Edsgar Dijkstra (creator of the Dijkstra's algorithm) opposed how the early programs had no rules on how to lay them out, in particular Dijkstra opposed the <b>GOTO statement</b> (this statement transfers control unconditionally to some other point in a program) because he thought that it made program’s <b>harder to read and maintain.</b></li>

			  <li>Structured programming became popular because of the discovery of how any computable function can be carried out by using only three types of programming constructs:
				<ul type="square">
				  <li><b>Sequence</b> is where you <b>execute one statement/subprogram after another.</b></li>
  				  <li><b>Selection</b> is where you <b>branch</b> of to a different place in a program according to the value of the boolean expression.</li>
				  <li><b>Iteration</b> is where you <b>repeat</b> a section of code until a boolean expression is true.</li>
				</ul>
			  </li>
			  			  
			  <li>Structured programming uses decomposition because it breaks a process down into well- defined steps.</li>

			  <p></p>
			  
			  <li><b>Object oriented programming</b> is a programming paradigm that is based around objects.</li>
			  
			  <li>It <b>breaks down problems amd functionality</b> at the same time because an object, which is based on a <b>class (template that contains attributes/data)</b> and <b>methods (code for that specific object)</b>, can be isolated from others - which decreases the amount of errors due to interference and allows you to reuse the object for similar problems.</li>

			  <p></p>
			  
			  <li>Algorithms are a <b>series of step-by-step calculations</b> that are needed to solve a problem.  You use algorithms by getting value(s) as the input and then apply the algorithm to it to get an output value(s). Algorithms <b>need data to work</b>.</li>

			  <li>Algorithms needs to be <b>created using decomposition</b> to break the problem into smaller parts which will help to plan out the solution/algorithm which will help to create the program.</li>

			  <li>Designers need to understand these “RULES” to produce an efficient working algorithm:
				<ul type="square">
				  <li>Algorithms <b>must describe what they are meant to do</b> otherwise it could lead to errors due to vagueness. This is because computers don’t understand vagueness.</li>
  				  <li>Algorithms <b>must end</b> because if it doesn’t finish you don’t get a result which is why you need to remember to put an end condition in a recursive algorithm.</li>
				  <li>Algorithms <b>must be correct</b> because if it isn’t the end result won’t be correct.</li>
				  <li>Algorithms <b>must work with any instance of the same problem</b> so that the computer can work with similar data sets which would make the process quicker.</li>
				</ul>
			  </li>

			  <li>After an algorithm has been created a programmer should be able to translate the algorithm into code.</li>
